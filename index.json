I completed my undergraduate from IIIT Hyderabad in August 2016.\nI am interested in studying the theoretical foundations of machine learning. My research interests span over randomized dimensionality reduction, generative models, compressed sensing and statistical machine learning.\nI spent the summer of 2020 as an Applied Science intern at Amazon Alexa NLU where I was advised by Dr. Abdalghani Abujabal and Dr. Claudio Delli Bovi. Prior to my masters, I spent 2 years building statistical models at the Surveillance Analytics Group, Goldman Sachs led by Dr. Mayur Thakur.\nEmail: agajjar \u0026lsquo;at\u0026rsquo; umass \u0026lsquo;dot\u0026rsquo; edu\nResearch  Subspace Embeddings Under Nonlinear Transformations\nAarshvi Gajjar and Cameron Musco\nConference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2021).\n We study methods for obtaining low-distortion embeddings of low-dimensional subspaces under nonlinear transformations. We show that piecewise linear approximations of many common neural network nonlinearities can be applied to give embedding results using random embedding matrices.
